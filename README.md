# Open for learning

The Open Learning Platform, an open source learning experience platform (LXP) solution that helps learning teams achieve both freedom to learn and freedom to innovate. 

## What is a learning experience platform?

A learning experience platform (LXP) provides a personalized, online learning experience for users, typically employees at large enterprises. It consolidates disparate learning resources into a single portal. These days, learning can happen anywhere and in many forms. An LXP helps employees discover learning opportunities, offers ways to enhance them, and manages all their learning. 

This innovative open source platform, winner of the [2019 Totara Best Technology and Media project award](https://www.totaralearning.com/customer-stories/red-hat), was created in a Red Hat-Synegen partnership. Proving that open collaboration drives innovation.
